# Natural-Language-Object-Retrieval_tf
Implement [Natural Language Object Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04164) in Tensorflow. The original code is release [here](https://github.com/ronghanghu/natural-language-object-retrieval), written in Caffe.


## What is natural language object retrieval?
In real AI, you may refer something with its location, color, or other charateritic. The AI robot should know where the corresponding object is. Here's the illustration:   
   
   
## Requirement   
- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
- Caffe, you can download in [here]()
- 


## Training
Here, all the experiments are done on [ReferIt](http://tamaraberg.com/referitgame/) dataset. You can also train on other dataset in the same way.
